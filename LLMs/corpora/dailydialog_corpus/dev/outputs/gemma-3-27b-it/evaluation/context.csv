Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic .

<user> Yes . I want to get a better job . </user>
<assistant> That's great that you're actively thinking about what you want! What does a better job look like to you? </assistant>
<user> I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues . </user>
<assistant> Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Dissatisfying salary and difficult colleagues are definitely valid reasons to look for something new. </assistant>
<user> I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay . </user>

<assistant> That's a great idea! Sublets can be a good short-term solution, and sometimes you can even find longer-term options that way. </assistant>
<user> I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month . </user>
<assistant> Okay, 1,000 yuan is definitely a budget to keep in mind. That will narrow down the search quite a bit, especially depending on the city. </assistant>
<user> It doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route . </user>
<assistant> Right, location is key! Being near public transport will save you so much time and money. Do you have a preferred subway line or bus route you'd like to be close to? </assistant>
<user> I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side . </user>
<assistant> A sunny bedroom with a full bath – excellent! Those are good priorities. That does make the 1,000 yuan budget a bit more challenging, but not impossible. </assistant>
<user> Why ? Will those be students who are leaving ? </user>
<assistant> Well, a lot of places within that budget tend to be shared apartments with students or young professionals. Students graduating or going abroad often leave rooms available, and those are sometimes good deals. </assistant>
<user> Thank you . I'll be sure to take a look . </user>

<assistant> We offer a few different repayment options. You can choose between equal monthly installments, or interest-only payments for a set period followed by principal and interest payments. Which option sounds more appealing to you? </assistant>
<user> Does that mean I should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest ? </user>

<assistant> I need to file a complaint . </assistant>
<user> What is your complaint about ? </user>
<assistant> I got robbed . </assistant>
<user> When did this happen ? </user>
<assistant> Yesterday evening, around 8 PM. </assistant>
<user> What was taken ? </user>
<assistant> My wallet, phone, and a necklace. The wallet had about $200 in cash, my driver's license, and a couple of credit cards. </assistant>
<user> Did you get a good look at the person who robbed you ? </user>
<assistant> Not really, it happened so fast. It was dark, and they had a hoodie pulled up. I think they were tall, maybe around 6 feet, and wearing dark clothing. </assistant>

<user> Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money . </user>
<assistant> Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ? </assistant>
<user> Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . </user>
<assistant> I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . </assistant>
<user> But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . </user>

<user> Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription . </user>
<assistant> It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills . </assistant>
<user> Yes , I need to refill it today . </user>
<assistant> Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice . </assistant>
<user> I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not . </user>
<assistant> Okay. So, to get another refill, you'll need to contact your doctor's office and request a new prescription. Would you like me to look up their number for you? </assistant>
<user> Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ? </user>
<assistant> I understand this is urgent, and I truly wish I could help. However, I am legally unable to dispense medication beyond the authorized refills. </assistant>
<user> But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription . </user>
<assistant> I completely understand your situation and how uncomfortable this must be. Unfortunately, overriding the refill limit is something I'm not authorized to do, even in emergency situations. </assistant>
<user> But I have a prescription . I just need more of it . </user>
<assistant> You are right, you do have a valid prescription, but the prescription itself only allows for a certain number of refills. </assistant>
<user> Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor . </user>
