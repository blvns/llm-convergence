<user> Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? </user>
<assistant> As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . </assistant>
<user> Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . </user>
<assistant> So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . </assistant>
<user> The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? </user>
<assistant> Let's say 15 percent reduction, and we'll also include a complimentary extended warranty on the product. That would bring the price down to 75 percent of your original offer. </assistant>
<user> That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut . </user>

Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic .

I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . </assistant>
