<user> Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . </user>

<user> Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market .

This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . </user>
<assistant> I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . </assistant>
<user> But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . </user>

<user> Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . </user>

A 10 % commission will not leave us much . </user>
<assistant> I see your point. But we're not looking for a short-term deal. We want a long-term relationship with our agents. And we're willing to pay a premium for that. </assistant>

<user> Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . </user>
<assistant> That's true. We can save money by looking ourselves. </assistant>
<user> Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . </user>
<assistant> Exactly. And the commission is usually a percentage of the price of the house. </assistant>
<user> Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them . </user>
<assistant> I know. I just don't want to pay someone else to do something we can do ourselves. </assistant>
<user> Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . </user>
<assistant> That's a good point. Your friends can give us free legal advice. </assistant>
<user> It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . </user>
<assistant> It's a lot of work, but we can do it. We can start this weekend. </assistant>
<user> Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . </user>
<assistant> That way we can avoid the realtor's commission. </assistant>
<user> Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . </user>
<assistant> Exactly. And that means we'll have to pay a higher price. </assistant>
<user> It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . </user>
