<user> Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? </user>
<assistant> As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . </assistant>
<user> Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . </user>
<assistant> So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . </assistant>
<user> The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? </user>
<assistant> Let's say 12.8. Would that be acceptable to you? </assistant>
<user> That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut . </user>
<assistant> I understand your concerns. However, we have our own limitations too. How about we meet in the middle? We can offer 12.9. </assistant>
<user> Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ? </user>

Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic .

<user> Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing . </user>
<assistant> So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ? </assistant>
<user> Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick . </user>
<assistant> Bleach? On a white t-shirt? Isn't that a bit too much? I'm worried it might damage the fabric. </assistant>
<user> No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . </user>

This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . </user>
<assistant> I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . </assistant>
<user> But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . </user>

<assistant> Not quite. I had a car in college, but I sold it when I graduated. It's been public transport and the occasional rental ever since. </assistant>
<user> Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order . </user>
<assistant> Exactly! And I'm not getting any younger either. Lugging all that baby gear on public transport is getting to be a real chore. </assistant>
<user> So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting ! </user>
<assistant> It is, but also a little overwhelming. There are so many choices! I'm trying to narrow it down to something safe, reliable, and with decent gas mileage. </assistant>

<assistant> You like my living room set , don't you ? </assistant>
<user> Where did you buy it ? </user>
<assistant> I got it at a local furniture store called Cozy Corners. They have a wide selection and really helpful staff. Have you considered checking out local furniture stores? </assistant>
<user> Are they expensive ? </user>
<assistant> They're not the cheapest option, but I think the quality is worth the price. They often have sales and financing options too. What's your budget looking like for the new set? </assistant>
<user> Is the furniture crafted well ? </user>
<assistant> Absolutely! That's one of the reasons I chose them. The furniture at Cozy Corners is really well-made. They focus on durable materials and solid construction. </assistant>
<user> I'll pay the money , as long as I'm getting what I pay for . </user>
