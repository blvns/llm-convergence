He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.
